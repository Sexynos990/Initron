As of 2025 july 27th i shall mention you shouldnt use initron (better name would be accepted)
Code is an absolute mess compared to other inits and this is more of a let me hit you with rust for the memes.
But if you actually want this (i do not know why) pull requests are open...or just fork it like a normal person given i am not that good at maintaing a clean commit history if i even maintain it.
